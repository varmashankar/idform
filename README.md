## Setup

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Ensure you have internet access for Firebase and Bootstrap CDN

### Production Setup
1. Set up environment variables for Firebase configuration:
   ```bash
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
   ```

2. Deploy to a web server with HTTPS (required for service worker)
3. The app will automatically register the service worker for offline support

## Usage

### Core Features
- **Calculators**: Use the side menu to navigate between different price calculators
- **Description Generator**: Generate product descriptions with the built-in template system
- **Feedback System**: Submit feedback and receive real-time notifications for admin responses
- **Offline Mode**: App works offline with cached resources and queued operations

### Advanced Features
- **User Identification**: Set a username for better cross-device identification
- **Real-time Notifications**: Get instant notifications when admins respond to feedback
- **Performance Analytics**: View app performance metrics in browser console
- **PWA Installation**: Install the app on mobile devices for native-like experience

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test all calculators with various input values
- Verify feedback submission and notification system
- Test offline functionality by disabling network
- Check PWA installation on mobile devices
- Verify error handling with invalid inputs

### Performance Testing
- Monitor page load times in browser dev tools
- Check service worker caching functionality
- Test app performance in different network conditions
- Verify analytics tracking in browser console

### Accessibility Testing
- Test keyboard navigation throughout the app
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast and visual accessibility
- Test focus management in modals and forms

## Code Structure

### Key Files
- `main.js` - Core application logic and feature implementations
- `style.css` - Main styling with modern design system
- `sw.js` - Service worker for offline support
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest for app installation
- `feedback.js` - User feedback display logic
- `admin/feedResponse.js` - Admin interface functionality

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Feature-based organization with clear separation
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling at multiple levels
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and performance tracking
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Security

### Firebase Security
- Use environment variables for production Firebase configuration
- Implement proper Firestore security rules
- Never expose sensitive credentials in client-side code

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization for all user-generated content
- Secure user identification without storing sensitive data
- Local storage encryption for sensitive user preferences

### Recommended Firestore Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /feedback/{feedbackId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /responses/{responseId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance & Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Static Assets**: CSS, JS, and images cached for offline use
- **Dynamic Content**: Firebase data cached with intelligent invalidation
- **Service Worker**: Handles caching and offline functionality

### Performance Monitoring
- **Page Load Metrics**: Track DOM content loaded and total load times
- **User Interactions**: Monitor feature usage and user behavior
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- **Analytics**: Local storage-based analytics with 30-day retention

### Optimization Tips
- Compress images before deployment
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Consider implementing lazy loading for large datasets
- Monitor bundle size and consider code splitting for larger features

## Browser Support

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome**: 60+ (Full PWA support)
- **Firefox**: 60+ (Full PWA support)
- **Safari**: 11.1+ (Limited PWA support)
- **Edge**: 79+ (Full PWA support)

### Progressive Enhancement
